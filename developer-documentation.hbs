## Requirements

Auto Encrypt Localhost is supported on:

  - __Node:__ LTS (currently 12.16.1).
  - __ECMAScript:__ [ES2019](https://node.green/#ES2019)

## Overview of relationships

![Dependency relationship diagram for Auto Correct](artefacts/dependency-graph.svg)

__Not shown (for clarity):__ third-party Node modules, the `util` namespace with helper modules – for logging, error handling, and an async `forEach` implementation – and the `typedefs` namespace with JSDoc type definitions.

## How it works in more detail

Auto Encrypt Localhost is a Node.js wrapper for [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/) that:

  * Uses the 64-bit release binaries to support Linux, macOS, and Windows.

  * Automatically installs the _certutil_ (nss) dependency on Linux on systems with apt, pacman, yum (untested) and  and on macOS if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) (untested).

  * Creates a root Certificate Authority.

  * Creates locally-trusted TLS certificates for localhost, 127.0.0.1, and ::1.

You can use these certificates for local development without triggering self-signed certificate errors.

For more details on how Auto Encrypt Localhost works behind the scenes, please [see the mkcert README](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/blob/master/README.md).
